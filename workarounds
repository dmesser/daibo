= No Route to Host on oc cluster up =

* Initial cluster up appears successful, but the router isn't configured correctly
* Solution is to flush iptables (below)
* https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/12546

oc cluster down
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo systemctl start docker
oc cluster up

= Nodes cannot access registry at docker-registry.default.svc =

* Error looks something like:

dial tcp: lookup docker-registry.default.svc on 10.224.20.20:53: no such host

* There is a supposed fix committed, but I'm still seeing it. As a workaround,
  I manually added the following to each node's /etc/resolv.conf

search svc.cluster.local cluster.local
